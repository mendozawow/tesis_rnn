abstract = {The continued growth and diversification of the Internet has been accompanied by an increasing prevalence of attacks and intrusions [40]. It can be argued, however, that a significant change in motivation for malicious activity has taken place over the past several years: from vandalism and recognition in the hacker community, to attacks and intrusions for financial gain. This shift has been marked by a growing sophistication in the tools and methods used to conduct attacks, thereby escalating the network security arms race. Our thesis is that the reactive methods for network security that are predominant today are ultimately insufficient and that more proactive methods are required. One such approach is to develop a foundational understanding of the mechanisms employed by malicious software (malware) which is often readily available in source form on the Internet. While it is well known that large IT security companies maintain detailed databases of this information, these are not openly available and we are not aware of any such open repository. In this chapter we begin the process of codifying the capabilities of malware by dissecting four widely-used Internet Relay Chat (IRC) botnet codebases. Each codebase is classified along seven key dimensions including botnet control mechanisms, host control mechanisms, propagation mechanisms, exploits, delivery mechanisms, obfuscation and deception mechanisms. Our study reveals the complexity of botnet software, and we discusses implications for defense strategies based on our analysis.},

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered.},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image de- scription and retrieval problems, and video narration chal- lenges. In contrast to current models which assume a ﬁxed spatio-temporal receptive ﬁeld or simple temporal averag- ing for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional mod- els are “doubly deep” in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal “layers”. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or train- ing data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the net- work state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural lan- guage text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual rep- resentations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately deﬁned and/or optimized.},

Although it is generally accepted that more comparisons with third-party methods may help to improve the area, few papers could do it. Among the factors that prevent a comparison are the difficulties to share a dataset, the lack of a good dataset, the absence of a proper description of the methods and the lack of a comparison methodology. This paper compares the output of three different botnet detection methods by executing them over a new, real, labeled and large botnet dataset. This dataset includes botnet, normal and background traffic. The results of our two methods (BClus and CAMNEP) and BotHunter were compared using a methodology and a novel error metric designed for botnet detections methods. We conclude that comparing methods indeed helps to better estimate how good the methods are, to improve the algorithms, to build better datasets and to build a comparison methodology.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

abstract = {To date, techniques to counter cyber-attacks have predominantly been reactive; they focus on monitoring network traffic, detecting anomalies and cyber-attack traffic patterns, and, a posteriori, combating the cyber-attacks and mitigating their effects. Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging. We are currently exploring labeling flows as suspicious and non-suspicious based on telltales of hosts being compromised},

In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free op- timizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN ar- chitecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or gated) con- nections which allow the current input charac- ter to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character- level language modeling a hierarchical non- parametric sequence model.

abstract = {With existent uses ranging from motion detection to music synthesis to financial forecasting, recurrent neural networks have generated widespread attention. The tremendous interest in these networks drives Recurrent Neural Networks: Design and Applications, a summary of the design, applications, current research, and challenges of this subfield of artificial neural networks. This overview incorporates every aspect of recurrent neural networks. It outlines the wide variety of complex learning techniques and associated research projects. Each chapter addresses architectures, from fully connected to partially connected, including recurrent multilayer feedforward. It presents problems involving trajectories, control systems, and robotics, as well as RNN use in chaotic systems. The authors also share their expert knowledge of ideas for alternate designs and advances in theoretical aspects. The dynamical behavior of recurrent neural networks is useful for solving problems in science, engineering, and business. This approach will yield huge advances in the coming years. Recurrent Neural Networks illuminates the opportunities and provides you with a broad view of the current events in this rich field.},

abstract = {Statistical language models are crucial part of many successful applications, such as au- tomatic speech recognition and statistical machine translation (for example well-known Google Translate). Traditional techniques for estimating these models are based on N- gram counts. Despite known weaknesses of N-grams and huge efforts of research commu- nities across many fields (speech recognition, machine translation, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, data compression, psychology etc.), N-grams remained basically the state-of-the-art. The goal of this thesis is to present various archi- tectures of language models that are based on artificial neural networks. Although these models are computationally more expensive than N-gram models, with the presented techniques it is possible to apply them to state-of-the-art systems efficiently. Achieved reductions of word error rate of speech recognition systems are up to 20{\%}, against state- of-the-art N-gram model. The presented recurrent neural network based model achieves the best published performance on well-known Penn Treebank setup. Kl´cov´},

In this paper we attempt to improve the under- standing of the underlying issues by explor- ing these problems from an analytical, a geo- metric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet ef- fective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gra- dients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the experimental section.},

abstract = {Botnets have become one of the major threats on the Internet for serving as a vector for carrying attacks against organizations and committing cybercrimes. They are used to generate spam, carry out DDOS attacks and click-fraud, and steal sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a new approach for characterizing and detecting botnets using network traffic behaviors. Our approach focuses on detecting the bots before they launch their attack. We focus in this paper on detecting P2P bots, which represent the newest and most challenging types of botnets currently available. We study the ability of five different commonly used machine learning techniques to meet online botnet detection requirements, namely adaptability, novelty detection, and early detection. The results of our experimental evaluation based on existing datasets show that it is possible to detect effectively botnets during the botnet Command-and- Control (C{\&}C) phase and before they launch their attacks using traffic behaviors only. However, none of the studied techniques can address all the above requirements at once.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excel-lent performance on difficult learning tasks. Although DNNs work well whenever large labeled training sets are available, they cannot be used to map sequences to sequences. In this paper, we present a general end-to-end approach to sequence learning that makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure. Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Fi-nally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

abstract = {Automatically describing the content of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence that connects computer vision and natural language processing. In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU score improvements on Flickr30k, from 55 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 27.},
