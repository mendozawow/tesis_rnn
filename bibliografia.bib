abstract = {Abstract The results of botnet detection methods are usually presented without any comparison. Although it is generally accepted that more comparisons with third-party methods may help to improve the area, few papers could do it. Among the factors that prevent a comparison are the difficulties to share a dataset, the lack of a good dataset, the absence of a proper description of the methods and the lack of a comparison methodology. This paper compares the output of three different botnet detection methods by executing them over a new, real, labeled and large botnet dataset. This dataset includes botnet, normal and background traffic. The results of our two methods (BClus and CAMNEP) and BotHunter were compared using a methodology and a novel error metric designed for botnet detections methods. We conclude that comparing methods indeed helps to better estimate how good the methods are, to improve the algorithms, to build better datasets and to build a comparison methodology.},

@article{Hochreiter1997,
abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

@article{Livadas2006,
abstract = {To date, techniques to counter cyber-attacks have predominantly been reactive; they focus on monitoring network traffic, detecting anomalies and cyber-attack traffic patterns, and, a posteriori, combating the cyber-attacks and mitigating their effects. Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging. We are currently exploring labeling flows as suspicious and non-suspicious based on telltales of hosts being compromised},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

Botnets are networks of infected computers, which are headed by a pirate called also 'Attacker' or 'Master'. The botnets are nowadays mainly responsible for large-scale coordinated attacks. The attacker can ask the infected computers called 'Agents' or 'Zombies' to perform all sorts of tasks for him, like sending spam, performing DDoS attacks, phishing campaigns, delivering malware, or leasing or selling their botnets to other fraudsters anywhere. In this paper we present a classification that reflects the life cycle and current resilience techniques of botnets, distinguishing the propagation, the injection, the control and the attack phases. Then we study the effectiveness of the adopted taxonomy by applying it to existing botnets to study their main characteristics. We conclude by the upcoming steps in our research.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach for characterizing and detecting botnets using network traffic behaviors. Our approach focuses on detecting the bots before they launch their attack. We focus in this paper on detecting P2P bots, which represent the newest and most challenging types of botnets currently available. We study the ability of five different commonly used machine learning techniques to meet online botnet detection requirements, namely adaptability, novelty detection, and early detection. The results of our experimental evaluation based on existing datasets show that it is possible to detect effectively botnets during the botnet Command-and- Control (C{\&}amp;C) phase and before they launch their attacks using traffic behaviors only. However, none of the studied techniques can address all the above requirements at once.},

abstract = {The continued growth and diversification of the Internet has been accompanied by an increasing prevalence of attacks and intrusions [40]. It can be argued, however, that a significant change in motivation for malicious activity has taken place over the past several years: from vandalism and recognition in the hacker community, to attacks and intrusions for financial gain. This shift has been marked by a growing sophistication in the tools and methods used to conduct attacks, thereby escalating the network security arms race. Our thesis is that the reactive methods for network security that are predominant today are ultimately insufficient and that more proactive methods are required. One such approach is to develop a foundational understanding of the mechanisms employed by malicious software (malware) which is often readily available in source form on the Internet. While it is well known that large IT security companies maintain detailed databases of this information, these are not openly available and we are not aware of any such open repository. In this chapter we begin the process of codifying the capabilities of malware by dissecting four widely-used Internet Relay Chat (IRC) botnet codebases. Each codebase is classified along seven key dimensions including botnet control mechanisms, host control mechanisms, propagation mechanisms, exploits, delivery mechanisms, obfuscation and deception mechanisms. Our study reveals the complexity of botnet software, and we discusses implications for defense strategies based on our analysis.},

Using character-level language models as an interpretable testbed, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of their representations, predictions and error types. In particular, our experiments reveal the existence of interpretable cells that keep track of long-range dependencies such as line lengths, quotes and brackets.

Finally, we provide detailed error analysis that suggests areas for further study.},

In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free op- timizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN ar- chitecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or gated) con- nections which allow the current input charac- ter to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character- level language modeling a hierarchical non- parametric sequence model.
